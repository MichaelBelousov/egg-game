# Egg Game

Some simple game my Dad played as a kid, used as a discussion for how
to implement difficulty for such a game. You're a wolf catching eggs
falling from trees.

I did some of the math necessary to bound the random variables such that you always end up
with a smooth difficulty curve. But this first iteration is just a simple incremental random difficulty
implementation.

Potential future iterations may explain how to create a perfect difficulty curve, and
implement it.

## Using godot

Forgive me father for I have sinned.
I absolutely have sinned here by making such a simple game for the web in godot. It would be a much much smaller
bundle using just about any HTML5 game engine or even better the HTML5 canvas API. I will do that eventually.
